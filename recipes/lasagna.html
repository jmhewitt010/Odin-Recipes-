  <p>
    Lasagna is a rich and decadent Italian dish made with soft flat noodles and a hearty meat sauce and ricotta cheese. These are layered to perfection and 
    then topped with lucious mozzarella cheese and then baked to perfection.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Cheese Mixture</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese (2 cups)</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Meat Sauce</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>¾ lb. ground Italian sausage</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>40 oz. marinara sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lasagna Noodles / Cheese Topping</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage</li>
    <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Noodles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
    <li>Boil a large pot of salted water. Cook noodles to al dente according to package instructions.</li>
    <li>Stir gently to prevent sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>Lay the noodles flat on wax or parchment paper to cool while you assemble the lasagna.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Assemble</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
    <li>Add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping if needed.</li>
    <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, followed by about 1½ cups of meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 4 more noodles, another 1/3 of ricotta, and more sauce.</li>
    <li>Finish with 4 noodles, remaining ricotta, and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with 2½ cups of mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Spray foil with nonstick spray and place spray-side down on the baking dish.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bake</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bake covered for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake an additional 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
    <li>Let sit for 15 minutes before serving to set the layers.</li>
    <li>Serve with garlic bread and cheese.</li>
  </ul>
